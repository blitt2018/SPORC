In this case, it's different. Our guest is Matt Ridley, author of the book How Innovation Works. Trial and error is the secret source of innovation. Again and again, if you talk to great innovators, they stress the importance of trial and error. And swinging and missing is just as important as swinging and hitting. I'm not quite sure what that means, but I gather it's a baseball medley. Yes it is. Our show is about fixes. Yeah, how to make the world a better place. How do we fix it? How do we fix it? Nothing matters much more right now than the search, or perhaps it's a scramble, for a reliable vaccine that would work against coronavirus. But that breakthrough may not come from a single source or even one team of scientists. On this show, we look at innovation, which might be the most important phenomenon of the modern world. But innovation also causes a lot of disruption, which means there's a lot of resistance to it as well. We explore today with Matt Ridley,\n",

      "#51 - Matt Ridley on HOW INNOVATION WORKS\n",
      "Inside Stories and Storytellers Hosted by Trey Elling\n",
      "Hello readers! Matt Ridley is a journalist, businessman, member of Britain's House of Lords and a best-selling author. His new book is How Innovation Works and Why It Flourishes in Freedom. Matt, thank you for the time. The foundation of this book is not invention but innovation. To provide context for the rest of this conversation, what is innovation? Innovation is turning an invention into something that's practical and affordable and usable for everybody. It's the process of making an invention go viral. It's commonly thought that Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, but you point out that at least 12 people published or patented the idea before Edison, and 21 can claim to have drastically improved its design. So why does Edison get the credit? Well Edison is a very good example of someone who was more of an innovator than an inventor. He took the concept of the light bulb, which as you say, wasn't particularly original, about 21 different people had had the idea in different places, but he turned it into something practical that would work properly and that could be relied upon. In particular, the difficult problem to overcome was how to make a light bulb where the filament didn't burn out, even in a vacuum. And the key here was to make the filament out of the right kind of material that worked really well in terms of glowing, but lasting for a long time. Edison did 5,000 different experiments, looked at 5,000 different types of plant material until he settled on a type of Japanese bamboo that made the perfect light bulb filament. And as a result, he got light bulbs that would last a long time, and that's really why we remember him as the innovator of the light bulb. Edison famously said invention is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. And I think that's what he meant, is that you need to do a heck of a lot of trial and error to make something reliable, affordable and available. What is mold juice and why is it evidence that a lot of practical work is necessary to turn a scientific discovery into a useful innovation? A man named Alexander Fleming discovered mold juice, as he called it. We now know it as penicillin, and he discovered it by accident in 1928 when he went on holiday and left a petri dish on\n",

But for the moment, we're only really talking about one thing, the coronavirus crisis. In this episode, we're joined by the great Matt Ridley to discuss how innovation can get us out of this mess, whether the UK's lockdown will ever end, and the worrying rise of corona perpition. Hello and welcome to Last Orders, a spiked podcast. My name's Tom Slater and today, as ever, I'm joined by Chris Snowden from the Institute of Economic Affairs. Hello, Chris, how you doing? Hello, Tom, I'm not well, thanks. And today, we're absolutely delighted to be joined by Matt Ridley. Matt will be known to many of our listeners as a prolific writer and journalist on science and politics, a conservative peer in the House of Lords as well, and the author of a number of seminal books, including 2010's The Rational Optimist and a fantastic new book called How Innovation Works, which we're going to be talking about today. Matt, thanks so much for joining us today. Great to be on the show with you. Thanks for having me. So, Matt, to kick things off, I want to dive into your book. I imagine having a book come out in the midst of a pandemic has been difficult, but at least the kind of theme of innovation and how we can use human ingenuity to tackle this big problem that we're faced with. At least it makes the themes that you're touching on very, very pressing. But just to kick things off, could you tell us a little bit about what your kind of core thesis is\n",

Feifer, Entrepreneur’s Editor in Chief, pulls these stories out so other business can avoid the same crippling problems.\n",
      "From entrepreneur media, this is problem solvers, a show in which entrepreneurs do what entrepreneurs do best, solve unexpected problems in their business. We were completely wrong. And I'm just like, it's not selling. It was like, we have to start from scratch. I'm Jason Fyfer, the editor in chief of Entrepreneur Magazine. You know what word I used to really hate? Innovation. It's not because I hate innovation, it's because I hated how much people were using the word without really understanding it. I mean, oh, God, do you remember? Like, it used to be that everybody all the time was talking about how innovative they are. Every idea was innovative. Every new development was innovation. It was just nonstop. It was an innovation fest. And I kept looking at it and thinking, nobody knows what this means. This has become meaningless. But of course, innovation is not meaningless. Innovation is what drives our world. It's what drives our economy. It's what should drive us every single morning when we wake up. But the question is, if we're going to talk about real innovation, and now I would say is a particularly valuable time to do it at a time in which incumbencies are shaken up by a pandemic. And there are new opportunities and new needs. And boy, do we need innovation? We need people who are genuinely innovative. Well, then here's the question. How does innovation work? And guess what? I know someone who has the answer. I'm Matt Ridley. I'm the author of How Innovation Works and Why Flourishes in Freedom. I mean, if you're going to talk about how innovation works, you might as well find the guy who wrote a book called How Innovation Works. And Matt Ridley is a really interesting guy. He is a member of the UK House of Lords. He is a writer, he's got a weekly column in the Times of London, Right Regularly for the Wall Street Journal has written many best selling books, including the rational optimist and the evolution of everything. And his new book, indeed, How Innovation Works. So you call a guy like that up and you ask him, OK, the book's called How Innovation Works. How does innovation work? Well, innovation works in a surprisingly bottom up way. It's an inexorable, inevitable process that comes out of the interaction of individuals. And it\n",

Hello and welcome to the edition. The Spectators Weekly podcast is discussing some of the most important and intriguing issues within our pages with the writers behind them. I'm Cindy Yu. This week, as the government starts to looking at easing the lockdown, how much do we still not know about this virus? Also on a podcast, have Joe Biden and the Democrats being caught applying double standards? And at the very end, the upside of lockdown for new parents. In this week's cover piece, Matt Ridley writes about the problem with taming the virus. Matt joins me now together with Dr. Elizabetho Grapelli, who is a virologist at St George's University London. Matt, I think the problem you describe can be neatly summed up by an opening line in the magazine. We know everything about SARS-CoV-2 and nothing about it. Can you tell us about this COVID fog? Yeah, well, you know, it's puzzling, isn't it, that we can be so good at knowing its molecular biology, its genome sequence, what its genes are, how many there are, what they do, and yet we don't really understand how it's spreading. We don't understand the epidemiology nearly well enough. We don't know whether young people are passing it on. It seems like they possibly are not very much. I mean, why are some countries seeing big epidemics and others not? Why isn't it exploding in India and Africa, which many people feared it would do? There are all sorts of things we don't know about it, and that's the fog that we have to act in. We can't wait for knowing a lot before we act. It looks better. One of the things that we've heard a lot about is the science. Other scientists yourself, what do you make of that phrase? Yes, science is a word that we use a lot, but I think we use it in very different meanings. Sometimes we just mean the scientific community, sometimes we mean that actually just a scientific method. Other times we just mean the raw data that we actually need to put into a context and build a scenario. And I think as scientists, we are a bit guilty of taking some shortcuts when\n",

So you need my brand new free ebook, \"Your Facebook Friends Are Wrong About The Lockdown.\" Go pick it up at wrongaboutlockdown.com. Hi, everybody. Tom Woods here. I am so happy to be welcoming back to the show Matt Ridley, who is the author of numerous books. We're going to be talking about his most recent one, \"How Innovation Works and Why It Flourishes in Freedom.\" Since 2013, Matt Ridley has been a conservative hereditary peer with a seat in the House of Lords. He's chaired the UK bank Northern Rock. He's got a resume as long as my arm, basically. He's a fascinating and brilliant guy, and I couldn't be happier to have him back on. Welcome back, Matt. Thanks for having me on the show again. Just reminded people about your book, which is now available. Last time you were here, we had to pre-order it, but now people can get immediate gratification by heading over to Amazon or their favorite bookseller. I have a link to the book up at tomwoods.com/1666. I want to make sure we're selling hotcakes. Oh, that is tremendous to hear. That is tremendous. People need to know what you're saying here. First of all, the stories themselves about innovation in areas from the extraordinary to the mundane are very fulfilling intellectually and otherwise, but also some of the conclusions that you draw, well, that's really, really important. What are the institutional prerequisites and other types of requirements for innovation to flourish? Well, that seems to be rather an important thing to know about. So we're going to make sure we do not cover the same material from last time, and that's no problem because this book is full of material to talk about. So let's start with, again, something that is both a very, very important step forward, and yet at the same time, so simple as almost a seam mundane compared with something like the the worldwide web, and that's simply the simple light bulb and the story of its evolution from one kind of technology to another.

Matt Ridley is a British journalist and businessman. He has best known for his writings on science, the environment and economics, including the rational optimist and his new book, how innovation works and why it flourishes and freedom. In this conversation, we discuss how prosperity evolves, why optimism is important, the difference between innovation and invention, how innovation is bottoms up, why China has been so innovative, and the future of stateless innovation. I really enjoyed this conversation with Matt and I hope you guys do as well. Before we get into this episode though, I want to quickly talk about our sponsors. The first is BlockFi. They've got three products. I'm a huge fan of. The first is you can deposit crypto and receive a US dollar loan. You can buy and sell crypto on their new crypto exchange or you can deposit crypto and earn up to 8.6% APY in their interest bearing account. I personally am an investor and a happy user. Earning up to 8.6% APY is an unheard of interest rate. Head on over to block five.com/pomp and you can learn more again block five.com/pomp. Our second sponsor is Choice, a new self-directed IRA product that I'm really excited about. If you're listening to this, you're likely part of the 7.1 million Bitcoin owners who have retirement accounts with dollars in them, but not Bitcoin. I was in that situation too. But now you can actually buy real Bitcoin in your retirement account. I'm talking about owning your private keys and using tax advantage dollars to do it too. I highly recommend going to check out Choice. I've opened up an account with them and I'm super happy with it. So go in the description and you can click on the link there or you can go to retirewithchoice.com and check it out. Buying Bitcoin in your retirement account and holding your own private keys, Gamechanger.

They stress the fact that they didn't dream up the right answer at the beginning and just work their way towards it, they did a ton of experiments to try and find what worked and they found an awful lot of things that didn't work along the way. Thomas Edison, family said, \"I haven't failed. I've just found 5,000 ways that don't work.\" Matt Ridley is the best-selling author of books such as The Rational Optimist, The Evolution of Everything and his new book, How Innovation Works and Why It Flourishes in Freedom. That has also been an editor and writer for The Economist, The Times and The Wall Street Journal. On this episode, Matt discusses the history of innovation and how we need to change our thinking on the subject. He talks about how some of the most transformative inventions have come to be and how innovation is a collective, collaborative phenomenon, not a matter of lonely genius.

      "Every week on Power Hour energy philosopher Alex Epstein breaks down today's top energy, environmental, and climate issues.\n",
      "[MUSIC] Welcome to Power Hour. I'm Alex Epstein. Today's show is entitled How Energy Innovation Works. It's an interview with somebody I'm a big fan of, Matt Ridley. Matt wrote the book The Rational Optimist, which was a big influence on my thinking about energy and about progress in general. If you haven't read that book, it's still a definite must read. I think it's 10 years now since it came out, but super valuable, super topical today. I think a lot of the claims that it made and the predictions it made have definitely come true. But Matt has a new book called How Innovation Works, and the subtitle is, And Why It Flourishes Under Freedom. I've never had Matt on Power Hour before. I think I tried to get him years ago, but I wasn't able to. But now I am able to actually got to meet Matt in person several years ago. I think we were both speaking at an event in Texas, and it was really cool to meet him in person. The most memorable part, though, which is pretty funny, is that Matt is super tall. So I'm about six feet tall, but he's six-six. So there's just some picture of us, which maybe I'll hunt down, or I think I look like a dwarf compared to him. So yeah, it's really, you don't meet that many people, you know, outside an athletic context. Like when I was going to Duke, you know, we had these basketball players. You expect them. You don't expect one of your favorite writers to just be this giant. So you won't be able to tell this on the interview screen, even if you're watching, but that's just a random funny recollection of meeting Matt. But I think you'll really enjoy this interview. And what we're going to be focused on is what we can learn from his book, which is broadly about how innovation works and what we can learn with energy. Now I'll say this. I just recorded the interview, so I know exactly what we cover. I'll say this probably after the interview as well. But we only cover just a small fraction of what's covered in the book. So if you're interested in innovation, definitely recommend checking out the book. And maybe in a future episode, maybe a human flourishing project, I'll talk to him about\n",

And Matt spent a huge amount of time in this book digging into figuring out how innovation actually works and why it is so essential to the evolving prosperity of the human species. We cover a huge amount of ground in this conversation from the idea of this economic history of innovation to how Thomas Edison created the first innovation factory and was not the inventor that we think of, but actually perhaps the first modern innovator.

      "I'm here with Matt Ridley, who's the author of the new book, \"How Innovation Works and Why it Flourishes with Freedom.\" So thanks for joining me. David, it's great to be with you today. Now, I first read your book, \"The Red Queen,\" which was in college, and my goodness, you really did a good job of really sorting out a lot of the myth behind why we have the sexual dimorphism. Is that the proper term? Yeah, it is. You know, men and women look different, and that's true for most species, and there's a deep, deep evolutionary history behind males and females looking different and behaving different, and human beings are no exception, and it's important to realize the biology that underlies that and the evolutionary incentives that brought it about. That was sort of the big theme of the book. And then you also had another book, \"Nature via Nurture,\" which was another great book, because you were able to show that this dichotomy between nature versus nurture doesn't have to be what we think. It actually works hand in hand when you get into epigenetics and that kind of thing, right? That's right, and I genuinely think that what our genes do is predispose us to absorb the nurture, the environmental inputs that we need. So what they're not defining how we turn out, they're setting us up to absorb the teaching and other things that come with it. So, you know, when you think about it, when you remember something, it requires the switching on and off of genes in real time in your brain to actually do that. Oops, sorry, I just need to get rid of that call. It requires us to switch on and off genes in real time in our mind as we remember something. So that's an example of how it's wrong to think of genes as being nature and everything else as being nurture. It's much more a question of genes and environment working hand in hand. It's interesting that you called the book Nature, via nurture, you're dead right to do so. I'm amazed how many people interview me and say you wrote a book called Nature versus nurture. And I say, no, no, that's the whole point. So it turned out to be a really bad title because nobody noticed that I'd change the word versus to\n",

Well, social justice has been understood clearly for a while. And social justice is distributive justice. Social justice is about redistributing resources and opportunities. Social justice is not the same as the biblical idea and the biblical concept of justice. We also need to understand that social justice is built on the back of critical theory, which is all about the idea of hegemony and power structures. And hegemony may sound like a big academic word. It just means that there's a power structure that exists because of the individuals who set the rules of the game. And they did it in order to... The critical theory is Marxist.

Matt, good to chat with you today. Thanks, Jim. It's great to be with you. I've noticed from doing events in my many podcasts that listeners love when I read. So I'm just going to read a few sentences I've cobbled together from your book as the lead into my first question. You write in the book, \"Innovation is the most important fact about the modern world, but one of the least well understood. It is the reason that most people today live lives of prosperity and wisdom compared with their ancestors. And the main ingredient in the secret sauce that leads innovation is freedom. Freedom to exchange, experiment, imagine, invest, and fail. Liberals have argued since at least the 18th century that freedom needs prosperity. But I would argue that they have never persuaded we found a mechanism, the drive chain, by which one causes the other. Innovation is that drive chain, that missing link. Innovation is the child of freedom and the parent of prosperity.\" Matt, do you think you've written a contrarian book here in 2020? There's a seems to be a growing belief. We haven't innovated since the Apollo Space Program. Living standards have been stagnant for decades. Growth only helps the elite. Growth kills the climate. And innovation comes from smart central planners implementing industrial policy and carefully chosen sectors. Is this a contrarian book? Well it is, if those are your views, because I say that innovation is the product of free people exchanging ideas freely, and that yes, we are experiencing innovation.\n",

Plague, smallpox, cholera, typhoid, measles, polio, whooping cough, and many more eradicated or nearly so.\" It turns out that I and many others were wrong. How did you miss it? Well, two reasons. One is I got so used to people crying wolf and being wrong that, of course, I didn't pay enough attention to people who were crying wolf and were right. And actually, there are out there, some very prescient warnings about what's happening in Chinese wildlife markets, about what's happening in terms of understanding the infectivity of coronaviruses in bats in China. Turns out they can infect human beings without adapting first. They don't need to go through an evolutionary phase. They can go straight into us. That's a discovery that I'd missed, but it was made four or five years ago. So I think a big part of this is that we've been looking in the wrong direction.

      "[MUSIC] Welcome to Kibbe on Liberty. This week is super special for me. We have author Matt Ridley, famous for the rational optimist, both the book and the best-selling book and the blog. He has a new book out called How Innovation Works, and why it flourishes in freedom. It seems like a perfectly perfect time to talk about this subject because I feel like we need more rational optimism and lots of innovation to get out of the current pandemic crisis, both the natural causes and the man-made causes. Welcome, Matt. It's an honor to have you on the show. Matt, it's great to be on your show. Thank you for having me. I have to ask you, what's it like to launch a book in lockdown? Because all of the old rules of selling books, lots of signings and lots of promotion, I guess that stuff can't happen right now. That's right. I'm sitting at home, but I'm packing in a lot because of what I don't have to do is trek through airports and hotel forays and so on. I can do a lot of online stuff, and that feels like we've turned a corner on that, that people have got more comfortable with it, with all the different programs. I'm looking forward to doing more of this in the future, actually. I did a talk in Ecuador the other day. Well, the book's not yet on sale in Ecuador, but it will be one day. That would have been quite difficult to organise to find the time to get to Ecuador. I'm rather hoping this might flatten the world a bit. Yeah. I'm not saying it's a good thing that we're having a pandemic, but I'm saying that there are aspects of it that are not so difficult for someone like me, as they would be for other people in ordinary walks, in other walks of life. Well, needless to say, innovation is responsible for the fact that you and I can talk and that you can give a speech in Ecuador. And I've described myself as kind of privileged during this pandemic because Free the People is primarily a staff of remote people all over our country. We've always worked through technology. We distribute our product through technology. So we're not part of the sort of fallout from the physical lockdown. So that's an accident\n",

This is one of the leading podcasts in the space, and listening to this show is one of the fastest ways to learn and get up to speed on Bitcoin.\n",
      "Hello everyone and welcome to the Stefan Lavera podcast, a show about Bitcoin and Austrian economics. Today I've got a great guest for you, Matt Ridley. But first let me introduce the sponsors of the show. So the sponsors of the show are here. So Kraken, firstly, one of the world's biggest exchanges. They offer one of the most liquid exchanges. They're one of the longest standing. They should be one of your first choices in terms of if you're looking to buy Bitcoin or sell Bitcoin, this is where you go. Kraken are renowned for their security as well. They have Kraken security labs assessing the security, not just of Kraken, but also other peers and other parties in the Bitcoin industry. So make sure you check them out. They've also got CryptoWatch, which is cryptowat.ch. It's a trading and charting terminal. They've also got Kraken Pro Mobile Application, which is a beautiful mobile first designed application for you to take the best of Kraken on mobile, on the go. So the website for that is Kraken.com, as you can see on the screen. Next up is Coin Floor. So if you are in the UK or if you have any friends who are in the UK, this is the place to go to for Autobi. So you can see on the screen, as I'm putting on the screen, they have an Autobi functionality, which allows you to basically automatically buy every week or so. And you can set up very quickly and set up an automatic transfer from your bank into Coin Floor. And so it's also only got Bitcoin. So it won't confuse any of your friends if they might get confused by all coins and so on. So that's where you can find that. And Coin Floor are also introducing a really competitive affiliate scheme. So make sure you check them out there. They've got 39 months on that affiliate scheme. So go and look them up also. Next is Swan Bitcoin. So if you are in the US, this is the one for you. If you're looking for an easy way to automatically buy Bitcoin, Autostak, you can do it every week or every month. You can set up your US bank account to connect up with Swan Bitcoin. And so really you've got to also consider the psychology of just automatically buying. And Swan\n",

      "Amanpour is CNN International's flagship global affairs interview program hosted by Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour.\n",
      "Hello everyone and welcome to Ammanpour, here's what's coming up. A new era in human space travel dawns, but here on Earth, still stymied by a viral pandemic. I speak to Arizona Republican Senator Martha McSally as she bets her political future on President Trump, also ahead. Mike Bloomberg donates $10 million to boost testing and tracing in New York. I'm joined by his close aide and former campaign manager, Kevin Sheaky. Plus, what I think we need in the case of vaccines is a lot more platforms for how to develop vaccines faster. How innovation works, best-selling author Matt Ridley speaks to our Walter Isaacson about his new book and what it tells us about the obstacles to vaccine development. Welcome to the programme everyone. I'm Christiana Ammanpour, working from home in London. Humanity stands on the very edge of another major chapter in space exploration. This ex from Elon Musk is trying to make history by becoming the first private company to launch humans into orbit. This exciting scientific milestone perhaps only amplifies the tragedy down here on Earth, where the world is still being challenged by a virus. America's coronavirus death toll is nearing 100,000, with more than a dozen states reporting an uptick in new cases. The minorities continue to bear the brunt of these deaths and also of acts of police brutality on the streets. This shocking video captures another unarmed black man dying after a white policeman pinned him down, pushing his knee into George Floyd's neck while Floyd screams that he can't breathe for several minutes. All four Minneapolis officers involved have been fired and authorities are investigating the case. These issues are all playing into the presidential race, as my first guest tonight knows all too well. Martha McSally is a junior senator in the critical swing state of Arizona. She's facing a tough re-election battle in November, running against the former astronaut and gun control campaigner Mark Kelly. She's got a new book out too about her time as America's first female fighter pilot to see active duty. It is called Dare to Fly. Senator McSally is joining me now from Tucson, Arizona. Senator, welcome to the program. A lot to cover, really, and a lot of really important issues. But first, let me ask you, from your perspective, not just as a senator, but in the Air Force, what do\n",

      "The edition is sponsored by Charles Stanley, one of the UK's leading wealth managers, providing bespoke investment management and financial advice. Find out more at Charles-Stanley.co.uk. Hello and welcome to the edition. The Spectators Weekly podcast is discussing some of the most important and intriguing issues within our pages with the writers behind them. I'm Cindy Yu. This week, as the government starts to looking at easing the lockdown, how much do we still not know about this virus? Also on a podcast, have Joe Biden and the Democrats being caught applying double standards? And at the very end, the upside of lockdown for new parents. In this week's cover piece, Matt Ridley writes about the problem with taming the virus. Matt joins me now together with Dr. Elizabetho Grapelli, who is a virologist at St George's University London. Matt, I think the problem you describe can be neatly summed up by an opening line in the magazine. We know everything about SARS-CoV-2 and nothing about it. Can you tell us about this COVID fog? Yeah, well, you know, it's puzzling, isn't it, that we can be so good at knowing its molecular biology, its genome sequence, what its genes are, how many there are, what they do, and yet we don't really understand how it's spreading. We don't understand the epidemiology nearly well enough. We don't know whether young people are passing it on. It seems like they possibly are not very much. I mean, why are some countries seeing big epidemics and others not? Why isn't it exploding in India and Africa, which many people feared it would do? There are all sorts of things we don't know about it, and that's the fog that we have to act in. We can't wait for knowing a lot before we act. It looks better. One of the things that we've heard a lot about is the science. Other scientists yourself, what do you make of that phrase? Yes, science is a word that we use a lot, but I think we use it in very different meanings. Sometimes we just mean the scientific community, sometimes we mean that actually just a scientific method. Other times we just mean the raw data that we actually need to put into a context and build a scenario. And I think as scientists, we are a bit guilty of taking some shortcuts when\n",

I so enjoyed talking to you last time about the rational optimist and just geeking out with you, and my listeners loved having you on. Thank you very much for having me back on the show, Andrea. I really enjoyed it last time, and it's nice to have another go. Thank you, me too. And I enjoyed your latest book as well, which is purportedly an innovation manual, which I agree with. But I also enjoyed it as a history book, because you, about three-quarters of it, is just a series like, and you really cover a wide amount of ground. I mean, at one point, you go from the invention of dogs all the way to CRISPR, like it is the history of innovation. Well, it's stories.

      "The series features conversations between renowned scholars and our editor, Marian L. Tupy. The interviews focus on the global impact of COVID-19 and the continued importance of rational optimism.\n",
      "[MUSIC PLAYING] So, Matt Ridley, thank you so much for joining me. It's a very kind of you to join this video cast or whatever they call it. So I want to start talking about COVID, then talk about your new book, How Innovation Works. But before doing that, I just want to remind the audience that you are, of course, a celebrated author of The Rational Optimist, which came out exactly 10 years ago in 2010. And over the last 10 years, you have become one of the most prominent advocates and defenders of the concept of human progress. So let's start there. And maybe you can tell me whether you still remain an optimist in the long run about the future of our species. Yes, I very much do. This current pandemic is a setback. But there have been setbacks throughout the last 10 years. I've been going around talking about rational optimism for 10 years now. And every year, there has been a reason for people to say, well, you surely can't still be an optimist because of the Euro crisis, because of the war in Ukraine, because of the war in Syria, whatever the crisis of the day is. And those are serious crises, as is this one. But that doesn't prevent the fact that this has been an extraordinarily good decade. The last 10 years has been unbelievably good for poor people. It's not been quite so good for rich people, but that's the right way around. We'd rather it was good for poor people than rich people, I think. So if you take the continent of Africa, for example, the poorest continent and one that 10 years ago, people were still saying you cannot expect Africa ever to see the levels of prosperity or food security that you see in Asia, well, actually, you are now seeing that. You're seeing incomes double in 10 years in some countries. You're seeing warfare become much less common throughout the continent of Africa. You're seeing malaria mortality rates down by almost a half, since-- well, they've halved since the beginning of the century, but they've continued downwards at that rate in the last 10 years. So on the whole, in terms of lifting people out of poverty, in terms of reducing child mortality, in terms of defeating infectious disease, including most viruses, but not obviously this one\n",

      "As the crow flies on the Vance Crow podcast. What is up friends? My name is Vance Crow and you are watching the Vance Crow podcast. In just a moment, I'm gonna have one of the best interviews I have ever done with Lord Matt Ridley, who is author of How Innovation Works and Why It Flourishes in Freedom. It is such a fun conversation. I cannot believe I got to spend my Friday morning recording this interview with him all the way across the ocean over in the UK. Before I get to that interview, I wanna let you know that I have made a radical change in my business model. I'm still planning on giving speeches next year and I'm doing online conferences, but I've taken the coronavirus time to work out some classes, some ways of thinking and some ideas that I wanna share with podcast listeners. So I have put together a set of courses. Right now I have three of them and I'm gonna keep building them every single week. I'm gonna keep adding more and more to them. Some of them are about how to become more engaging, how to get rid of us and ums in your speech. And one of them is just a series of conversations that I have with my intern, Ali Ali, which has actually been a really fun, enriching and kind of exciting experience. He gets on there, he's been working on his projects, he tells me what problems he's encountering and then we kinda talk through how would I handle different situations. So it's just one person's opinion, but I know that the podcast listeners are super interested in getting better at communication at figuring out how can I do more, can I imagine a world in which I'm confident to talk about the things that I know about and to ask questions about the things that I don't. And I would love to be a part of that. So for podcast listeners, I need some beta testers and what I'm looking for is 15 people that I don't know I'm not connected with, I've never met before to write me and say, \"Hey, I want to be in the channel, I wanna check it out.\" And you can be one of the first people to take those three classes, let me know what you think, help\n",

      "Boy am I excited for this conversation. One of my favorite thinkers and writers you may know well many of his books one of the best known is called The Rational Optimist. Matt Ridley is a libertarian, a scientist, an author, a graduate of Oxford and a member of the British House of Lords. How about putting all of that on one CV? Matt Ridley, good morning and thanks so much for being with us today. It's a pleasure to have you. Good morning, Russell. Thanks for that kind introduction. I should mention Matt's new book is called How Innovation Works and Why It Flourishes in Freedom. And of course we got to talk about both aspects of that. But maybe we can start, Matt, with a slightly definitional thing. What's the difference between innovation and invention? Well I think it's a very important distinction between that coming up with the first device or the first prototype of a new thing versus getting it into production, getting it available to everybody, making it affordable, making it reliable. And actually that second half of the job is often harder and requires more genius in some ways than the first part. So I'm emphasizing the innovators, the people who took something that somebody had already developed like say vaccination or the internet, e-commerce or something like that and turned it into something that we could all use. So invention is part of innovation but it's a smaller part than we generally realize. One of the things that you mentioned in your book is something that you called the Amara hype cycle. And I think it's a fascinating concept. Could you talk about that a little bit? Yeah I love this. I tracked it back to this guy called Roy Amara who is the first person who sort of went around saying this. And it's been attributed to a lot of other people but actually it was him who deserves the credit. And it's this that in the long run we overestimate, sorry, in the long run we underestimate the impact of a new technology of an innovation but in the short run we overestimate it. So looking 10 years out we expect a new innovation to achieve more than it does. Looking 20 years out it achieves more than we expect. If you think about the internet you know around the year\n",
